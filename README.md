# Bank Customers Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of bank customers, focusing on variables such as balance, deposit, age, loan status, and more. The primary goal is to uncover the significance of the relationships between these key variables.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for the analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with the step-by-step EDA.
  - `EDA_Bank_Customers.ipynb`: Main notebook for the analysis.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts used for data preprocessing and analysis.
- `results/`: Output files and visualizations generated from the analysis.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Analysis Details

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the EDA phase, we:
- Loaded and cleaned the data.
- Performed descriptive statistics on variables such as balance, deposit, age, and loan status.
- Visualized distributions, correlations, and relationships between key variables.

## Results

The final output includes:
- Descriptive statistics and visualizations of key variables.
- Insights into the relationships between variables such as balance and deposit, age and loan status, etc.
- Identification of significant patterns and trends in the dataset.
